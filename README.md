# Strapi-menu-useContext

## Introduction

This is a simple React app built with Vite and designed to practice using the useContext hook. The app is inspired by John Smilga's React projects and utilizes a Strapi backend to provide menu items for a restaurant website.

## Installation

To run this app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app

Note: To access the menu items, you will need to have a Strapi backend running on your local machine. You can follow the instructions in the [Strapi documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html) to set up a local Strapi instance.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can browse the menu items by clicking on the "Menu" link in the navbar. You can also add items to your cart and view your cart by clicking on the "Cart" link in the navbar.

The app uses the useContext hook to manage the state of the cart items and pass the cart data between components.
